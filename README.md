Extensions and Themes for ESP3D-WEBUI v3

## Overview
This will be a collection of extensions and themes for [ESP3D-WEBUI v3](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI/tree/3.0) running on a [Jackpot](https://docs.v1e.com/electronics/jackpot/) board running [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC) on a [V1 Engineering](https://www.v1e.com) [LowRider 3 CNC](https://docs.v1e.com/lowrider/).  They may work on other CNC boards using ESP3D-WEBUI v3, but this is what they are tested on.

# Themes

## General Features
I like dark themes.

While themes are typically color and font changes, these themes share some other opinionated changes:
- Shrink the logo in the header to maximize vertical space which is helpful on mobile devices.
- Always display labels for macros.  These are typically hidden on narrow widths.
- Allow panels on the Dashboard to shrink the height to fit the content.  They normally have a fixed height which is less than ideal on mobile.
- Allow for custom logos on the right side below the header.  Normal and smaller size logos can be used if the normal logo is too large on mobile widths.

## V1E (Dark)
This is based around the V1 Engineering color scheme and includes V1 Engineering logos.

## FluidDark
This is based around the FluidNC color scheme and includes a FluidNC logo.
